The final user interface includes four main elements: an input field where users can type in the temperature, which includes validation to ensure that the input is numeric; a dropdown menu that allows users to select whether the temperature they're inputting is in Celsius or Fahrenheit; a "convert" button that, when pressed, triggers the temperature conversion process; and a display area where the converted temperature, along with its corresponding unit, is shown. This setup provides an intuitive and user-friendly way for users to easily convert temperatures between the two commonly used units.
